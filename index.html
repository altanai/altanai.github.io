        <h3>Service Orchestration and Transformation Engine</h3>
        <p> 
          Customer is a  Belgium Based Service Provider

          Service Orchestration and Transformation Engine is a software component which helps in orchestrating the interaction between different services. It enables reusing the existing services by allowing orchestration between
          IN–IN services, IN–SIP services, SIP–SIP services and SIP-Web services.
          
          Roles and Responsibilities
          Design and development of SIP services like Call Screening, Find Me Follow Me, Call Transferring, Voice Mail.
          Defining and executing interaction logic between various SIP services. Configuration of OpenCloud Service broker platform. 
          <!-- Combining the existing and new services on a migrated network for client.  -->
          Independently handling various tasks assigned with precision and quality within stipulated time.
          
          Tools/Environment
